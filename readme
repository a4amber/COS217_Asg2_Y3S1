should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the

unauthorized sources of information.

I like using the teststr.c to debug the code.
I had trouble figuring out how to use it at first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

No. Pointers are not able to retain content information about the address they possess - including size. Memory will be based on allocation which is done at declaration. There is no way to determine how much space is in the allocation and what is useful when a function is only passed a pointer.
